      <p>I do a lot of drawing including shading, water color pencils, and with markers.<br>
      I find time through the night and I carry a scketch book around with me everywhere.<br>

      I enjoy drawing flowers such as roses.<br>

      I rather enjoy their company and my family's.<br>
      I am very busy and so I can't always draw or enjoy what I'm doing because I'm so tired, not that I'm complaining!<br>
